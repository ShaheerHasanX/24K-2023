1. Create a branch with the name being your roll number.
2. Create a Problem.md file which contains an item list in which an algorithm is defined for finding even
and odd numbers.
3. Create a pull request and merge the request as well. (Attach screenshots)

Task 1: Implement an algorithm for determining if an Nth is a divisor of an n Number (i.e. 2 is a
divisor of 6). If so, determine if it’s an even number or odd number as well.
1) Ask the user to enter Divisor
2) Ask user for a Number
3) SET Quotient to Number/Divisor
4) If the Quotient is not equal to 0 or is less than 0, SET Quotient to (Quotient / Divisor).
5) Repeat step 4 until Quotient is equal to or less than 0, else move to Step 6.
6) If Quotient is not equal to 0, Print Divisor “is not the divisor.”.
7) Else , Print Divisor “is actually a divisor of “ Number.
8) If the right most digit of the Divisor is 2 or 4 or 6 or 8 or 0, Print Divisor “is Even”.]
9) Else, Print Divisor “is Odd”.
