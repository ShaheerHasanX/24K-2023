Objective 1: FLOWCHARTS (CONT.)

TASK 1: You are working at Toyota Indus Motors and want to assemble a car. Design a flowchart with proper process modules and decision structures to replicate a pipeline production.

Objective 2: PSEUDOCODE

TASK 2 Take three variables as input and add them without using the + operator (Use your head for this)

1) START
2) //INPUT/OUTPUT
3) INPUT Number 1
4) INPU	T Number 2
5) INPUT Number 3
6) // Variable and Initialization 
7) SET Total to 0
8) SET NewNum1 to 0
9) // PROCESS STEPS
10) SET NewNum1 to -1 * Number 1
11) SET Total to NewNum1 – Number 2
12) SET Total to Total – Number 3
13) SET Total to Total * -1
14) END

TASK 3: Create a small calculator which only does ‘+’ or ‘-‘Operations. (Hint: Take three variable inputs with one being used for the operator)

1) START
2) //INPUT/OUTPUT
3) INPUT Number 1
4) INPU	T Number 2
5) INPUT Operator
6) // Variable and Initialization 
7) SET Total to 0
8) // PROCESS STEPS
9) SET Total to Number 1 + Operator + Number 2
10) END


Objective 3: Algorithm

Task 1: Implement an algorithm for determining if an Nth is a divisor of an n Number (i.e. 2 is a divisor of 6). If so, determine if it’s an even number or odd number as well.

1) Ask the user to enter Divisor
2) Ask user for a Number
3) SET Quotient to Number/Divisor
4) If the Quotient is not equal to 0 or is less than 0, SET Quotient to (Quotient / Divisor).
5) Repeat step 4 until Quotient is equal to or less than 0, else move to Step 6.
6) If Quotient is not equal to 0, Print Divisor “is not the divisor.”.
7) Else , Print Divisor “is actually a divisor of “ Number.
8) If the right most digit of the Divisor is 2 or 4 or 6 or 8 or 0, Print Divisor “is Even”.]
9) Else, Print Divisor “is Odd”.

TASK 3: Implement an algorithm for making a simple calculator with all the operators (+,-,*,/,%)

1) Ask the user to Enter Number 1
2) Ask the user to Enter Number 2
3) Ask the user to Enter Operator
4) If the Operator equals to “+”, SET Answer to (Number 1 + Number 2)
5)Else If the Operator equals to “-”, SET Answer to (Number 1 - Number 2)
6) Else If the Operator equals to “*”, SET Answer to (Number 1 * Number 2)
7) Else If the Operator equals to “/”, SET Answer to (Number 1 / Number 2)
8) Else if the Operator equals to “%”, SET Answer to (Number 1 % Number 2)


Objective 4: GitHub

TASK 1: Create your repository with your roll number being your repo name
TASK 2: Upload the algorithms and pseudo codes in your repository
TASK 3: Create a small intro about yourself in the readme file with pictures and bullet points
